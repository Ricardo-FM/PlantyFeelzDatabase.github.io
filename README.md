### Description
This is a web application created for our client [Planty Feelz](https://plantyfeelz.com/). The application functions as a database for plant enthusiasts to explore the many wonders of owning a plant and providing them an application to research care information on that specific plant. The application also allows the client to add to, update, and/or delete directly from the database from the deployed application.

### Technologies

- JavaScript Framework: JQuery

### Brief Technical Overview
To build a MySQL database hosted on a node web server for plants where users can query the database through GET requests. The web app will then output the returned JSON to a polished UI through the Sequelize ORM. The webmaster (client) has the ability to update the database through POST requests. It will be deployed on Heroku.
